# Player difficulty
Stored in a component on the player.
Default is set to 0.

# The dungeons
* How many? 
* What should each be?
* Rewards for each?
* We want these to be done in a linear progression. 
  * That means your difficulty is determined by the highest level of dungeon completed
  * Players probably shouldn't be doing dungeons they aren't ready for.
  * Each dungeon should have some way to lead the player to the next.

# Mob Scaling
* Armor seems easy. Try interfering with the mobSpawnEvent and seeing how the rates for armor are done already.

# Commands
* Before building dungeons, we need commands to set a player's difficulty manually
