# Titans Trials
A mod that increases the difficulty of the game with a different take.

# The How
* Structure Based: Difficulty increases when players choose to defeat a particular dungeon.
* Rewarding: Completing a dungeon (and increasing the difficulty) gives the player a particularly valuable reward of some kind. Think the elytra in the end.
* Opt In: Some players won't want to engage with the content of this mod in the context of a server or modpack.

# Mob Empowerment
* Naturally spawning mobs (zombies, skeletons) are given better armor if possible.
* Ones that can't wear armor are instead buffed with potion effects and other stat boosts.

# Additional Mechanics
Similar to patrols, players who have defeated a dungeon are at risk of being pursued by vengeful mobs.
Patrols of mobs can spawn near them.

# The Lore 
On defeating the first structure, an ancient force known only as The Titan takes notice of the player.
They see the player's skills and decide that they are amused. The Titan watches with amusement as they empower the player's foes.
