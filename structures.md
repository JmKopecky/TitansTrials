# Lore
Tell a story of the aftermath of one way the Titanomancy could have gone, with both groups of gods having been dramatically weakened.
They were once all-powerful forces but are now incapable of doing much to directly interface with the mortal realm.
As the player garners the attention of The Titan, Hekate, their skills are first tested before they are judged as suitable.
Suitable to act on The Titans behalf. In exchange for gifts of great power, the player executes Hekate's will.

What is that will? Why, to finish what they started, of course. End the Titanomancy. Kill Kronos.
Now for the first stage of this mod, we ain't going that far. 
Instead, we simply end on the player killing one of the Titans that Hekate betrayed to join the gods instead.
Which titan will that be? Her father, Perses. Titan of destruction and chaos. 
As more structures are done, he notices that Hekate is gaining power and tries to stop the player by making the difficulty go brr.

# Structures

## First Structure (the intro)
* Lore themes of getting the attention of the Greek titan Hekate (though not explicitly said).
* Curiosity and hubris leads the player to assault the dungeon, which should be quite difficult.
* Theme: Crossroads. Some tower that acts as a nexus between life and death.
* Reward: TODO
* Gives some effect to the player that we use so the Titan can communicate to the player after their victory
* Leads to the next structure: with no explanation (perhaps from mob drop or something), the player is given something that hints or leads to the next structure. 
  * The lore text simply implies that the Titan is curious and wants to observe the player before taking any further action.

## Second Structure
* Torch-themed. The final boss should be themed with fire, and some of the mobs defending the structure should be doglike
* The lore here is that the Titan is testing the player to see if they can use them for one of their goals. 
* They're just some group of worshipers who were cursed and now the Titan wants them cleansed. 
* Therefore, this structure should be a temple of some sort to Hekate. 
* Theme: temple, corruption, distorted magic
* Reward: TODO
* After this is completed, the Titan will be giving the player a task, promising a boon upon its completion.
* This leads to the third structure, guiding the player to enter the underworld.

## Third Structure
* The underworld (in the nether), mirroring how Hekate is sometimes said to accompany Persephone to the underworld
* What does the Titan want the player to accomplish here? 
  * Find out who's trying to interfere, though she doesn't tell the player this. Not until after.
* So what's this structure that would enable them to find out who's interfering? 
  * The home of a prophet. They're insane naturally, great boss battle. But during it, they spill the beans.
* Theme: underworld, hell, whatever the home of a prophet might look like.
* Reward: TODO
* After this, The Titan explains a little more thoroughly what's going on. 
* Then they point the player to the next one.

After the third structure, the Titan explains that their influence over the mortal realm is limited.
But if they work together, she can forge gifts for the player in exchange for their help.
As for the increasing power of beasts? 
The Titan knows that another titan is trying to interfere in her plans, but not who.
Not until that third structure, however, when the player found out that the Titan causing problems was Perses, titan of chaos and destruction.
Also it'd be helpful if the Titan offered their name. They don't say though that Perses is their father, not yet.

## Fourth Structure
* The player is now going to try and hunt Perses down. 
  * Hekate knows (though it is not clear why yet) how to find him.
  * The culmination of this structure is that they finally know where to look.
  * So what is it? The site of the battle that broke the gods and the titans. 
  * If we want them to have been banished to The End, we need this to also be in the end. 
  * So a massive tower overlooking a battlefield or something of the sort.
  * Perhaps its own island in the middle of the empty void. 
* They go there, and at the top of the tower is the remains of where Zeus and Kronos faced off.
* All that's left is a shattered (frozen in time) arena, one containing a great amount of residual power.
* That power has combined to form some force (rather than one boss, maybe mobs steadily summon in stages or something IDK figure it out)
* After killing it, Hekate takes advantage of the power spike to fuel a locator spell, one that creates a final compass.
* That compass leads to where Perses fled after the battle, on the outskirts of the end. 
* Theme: island in the end, tower overlooking a battlefield, arena at the top of that tower.
* Reward: TODO

## Fifth Structure (The Finale) (For Now...)
* Banished to the outskirts of the end after a great battle
* Plan:
  * Well the situation is that Hekate is trying to kill her father here.
  * He knows it, she knows it, but the player doesn't. 
  * This is all over a war over which group of gods would rule, but now look. None of them rule.
  * "We're here at the threshold, the **_crossroads_**, the precipice."
  * So Hekate tries to convince Perses to stand down and surrender. He doesn't. 
    * That was his choice, his crossroad. Now he has to walk that path. 
  * Hekate orders the player to kill him, but is oddly silent for the ensuing boss fight.
* What should this look like?
  * You're fighting a literal Titan. We need this to be an epic finale. 
  * On being banished, Perses created a structure around himself as a shield or defense so he could recuperate.
    * This structure is a giant sphere around which islands of the end have formed.
    * There is one entrance: the entirety of the shell is some unbreakable block. 
    * You fight through some rooms or whatever until you get to a central room/hall
    * The broken remains of the titan lay here.
  * It is from there that he has been influencing things remotely. 
* Aftermath?
  * Well, the difficulty only gets harder. What???
  * Hekate is all sad that she just had to kill her father, but confused as well.
  * Perses was the one influencing things, but it seems that with his death, 
    * many of the remaining titans and gods have taken notice
    * Hints at the titanomancy restarting.
